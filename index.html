            <p>I'm currently an employee in the scheduling department at Power and have recently applied to PCA in hopes that I can learn to become a developer. This is a new challenge that has been extremely rewarding so far, and I'm excited to continue learning more!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>JavaScript:
                    <p>I've learned how to use Javascript as a call and response tool (input and output), as well as learned to use it to create a more interactive web page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>HTML:
                    <p>I've learned to use HTML to build the basic layout of a web page including adding links, images, and content for the web page.</p>

                <li>CSS:
                    <p>I've learned to use CSS to create the design of how a web page will be viewed. You can use this to manipulate font, test size, colors, and many other things that are going to be presented on the web page.</p>
